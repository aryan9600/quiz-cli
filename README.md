## Quiz-CLI

Quiz-CLI is a command line tool for quizzes. You provide a `fileName.csv` with the structure "question, answer", and it lets you conduct a quiz in your terminal!

This is my first project in GoLang! :smiley:

This is a part of the [Gophercises](https://courses.calhoun.io/courses/cor_gophercises) by Jon Calhoun.

**Arguments**

* --csv : Name of the csv file
* --limit: Time limit for the quiz (in seconds)

**Example command**: `./quiz-cli --csv=problems.csv --limit=50`
